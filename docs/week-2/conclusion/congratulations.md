# Congratulations!

If you stuck to the timeline, you've made it through an _intense_ 2 weeks and learned a whole bunch of secrets about how to stand out during job interviews. 🙌🏻

You should be proud of yourself! You made a smart decision by taking the time to learn (or review) important job search strategies and brush up on the relevant skills needed to ace the interview.

If you put everything that you learned into practice, you'll be a better candidate and much more likely to win the job.
