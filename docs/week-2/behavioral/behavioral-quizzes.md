# Behavioral quizzes

Behavioral quizzes are those online tests where you’re asked questions like the one below. These aren't quite as fun as those viral ones where you find out which character you would be in your favorite TV show or which Hogwarts house you belong to (Gryffindor?), these are more about your personality and how you'd fit in the company's culture.

We're talking stuff like this -

:::note Example Behavioral Question

Which of the following statements best describes you?

- [ ] I like for things to be clearly structured.
- [ ] I look forward to the opportunity to learn new things.

It can feel like a trick question, can’t it? 😵‍💫

But behavioral quizzes are, for the most part, simply a way for a company to learn a little bit more about you.

The best thing you can do is be completely honest. (Shocker, right? We keep saying that...)

You might be wondering, “If there isn’t a right or wrong answer, why do I have to take the quiz in the first place?” Well, that’s a valid question, but there are plenty of reasons a company might give a quiz like this.

- **They want to find candidates with certain behavioral characteristics.** Maybe the company really needs risk-takers who don't need data before taking action for a particular role. Or maybe they need cautious, analytical thinkers who can be trusted to work with sensitive customer data.
- **They want their employees to succeed.** A big part of hiring is to put people in a role and environment where they can do their best work. This doesn't mean the company is right or the candidate's way of doing things is wrong - it's just about finding the right fit so that everyone can succeed.

Be honest, and be yourself. Because, hey, you're pretty awesome.
