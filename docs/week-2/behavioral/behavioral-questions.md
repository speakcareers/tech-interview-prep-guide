# Behavioral questions

When you make it past the coding assessments and behavioral quizzes, you'll often find yourself in a round of interviews that are less technical.

In behavioral interviews, the company will be looking to see what type of person you are and whether or not you'd make a good employee **_on their team_**.

- What are your values? Do they align with the company values?
- How well do you collaborate?
- Do you take ownership of projects/outcomes?
- Are you a strong communicator?

## Example questions

Here are some common interview questions that you should prepare answers for ahead of time.

1. Tell me about yourself.
2. Why do you want to work at this company?
3. What is your biggest professional strength/weakness?
4. Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a coworker.
5. Share about a project you lead that you are proud of. What were the results?
6. Tell me about a time that you made a mistake? Why? How could you avoid it in the future?

## Bonus tips for better answers

- Use 'I' statements. These answers should be about you and should give the interviewer a good idea of how you think and behave in certain situations.
- When sharing about a situation where something went wrong, be sure to share how you corrected the mistake or learned from the experience.
- Do not speak negatively of others, even if they were at fault for a costly mistake.
- If you plan to use data in your stories, be sure to include supporting information. Do not throw out numbers unless you mean them.
