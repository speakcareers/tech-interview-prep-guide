# Cohort challenge: Mock interview

The main purpose of a mock interview - a simulation of a real interview - is to get familiar with the interview context and increase your self-confidence. If you do this, you‚Äôll feel less nervous during the real interview - trust us! üòå

The more you practice answering behavioral questions, the better you can showcase your experience and intelligence while appearing natural and conversational. Think about how that will help you stand out.

## Conducting a Mock Interview

Pull up the STAR exercise and practice narrating each answer out loud.

When you're ready, head to the #pair-up-here channel in the discord and find a partner to trade mock interviews with this week. (Instructions below.)

üëâüèΩ After the session is over, complete the¬†[pair feedback form](https://airtable.com/shrVOc39Xb1toAdVD).

## Instructions

Use the STAR exercise from last week as your guide.

During the 60-minute session, spend the first 30 minutes with one of you being the interviewer and the other the interviewee. For the second 30 minutes, switch roles!

Talking in front of people can be stressful. Be constructive and kind to each other.

### Interviewer Instructions

- Read each question out loud in a friendly and inviting way.
- Let your partner finish their answers before interrupting or asking clarifying questions.

After the interview, assess the following to share constructive feedback:

1. How fully did they answer the question?
2. How compelling and convincing was their answer?
3. How long was their answer? Could it be more concise?
4. How was their body language? Did it match their words?
5. Are there any words that they repeat excessively? Most of us have a "like", "um" or an "actually" that we overuse when we‚Äôre nervous. Becoming aware of that helps us eliminate those speech patterns.
6. Where did their eyes go during the conversation? Were they maintaining eye contact with you?

### Interviewee Instructions

- Use the STAR method to answer.
- Try not to use your notes and answer each question as best you can. Be mindful of your timing, body language, and confidence.
- Take notes on any feedback and constructive criticism. Remember, you‚Äôre both trying to help each other improve.

For additional practice, you can do this on your own by recording yourself.¬†[View instructions](https://www.theguardian.com/careers/work-blog/how-to-set-up-and-conduct-mock-job-interview).
