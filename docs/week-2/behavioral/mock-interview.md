# Cohort challenge: Mock interview

Mock interviews are the BEST way to prepare for interviews. You'll get real practice and constructive feedback in a safe, supportive environment.

Past Speak\_ candidates tell us all the time that the mock interviews were the MOST helpful part of the cohort -- and candidates who go on to get hired at partner companies often cite the mock interviews as the main reason they felt confident and prepared on the day of their interviews.

For this cohort challenge, you'll get real practice answering common interview questions, working on your delivery, and fine-tuning your stories to be even more impactful.

**_Instructions on how to pair up are pinned in your cohort's Discord channel._**
