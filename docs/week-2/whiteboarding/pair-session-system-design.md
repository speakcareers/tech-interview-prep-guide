## Conducting a Whiteboarding Interview

For this whiteboarding session, let‚Äôs focus on a¬†*system design*¬†question.

You and your partner should each spend 30 minutes being the interviewee whiteboarding, and then switch roles.

When you're ready, head to the #pair-up-here channel in the discord and find a partner to trade whiteboard interviews with this week. (Instructions below.)

üëâüèΩ After the session is over,¬†[complete this pair feedback form](https://airtable.com/shr9fugg4aM8SHigE).

## Instructions

**Interviewer Instructions**

- Choose 1 or 2 system design questions from the list below to ask your partner.
- Read the question out loud in a friendly way and invite them to begin whiteboarding.
- Remind your partner to think out loud as part of the process.
- Ask clarifying questions when things aren‚Äôt clear, but don‚Äôt take the session over. Let them finish their thoughts and try to solve the problem with minimal input from you.

After the interview, assess the following:

- How fully did they answer the question?
- How compelling and convincing was their answer?
- Did they stay positive throughout the entire problem?
- How was their body language?
- Are there any words that they repeat excessively? Most of us have a "like", "um" or an "actually" that we overuse when we‚Äôre nervous.
- Were they maintaining appropriate eye contact with you?

**Interviewee Instructions**

- Follow the process you learned in the previous ‚ÄúWhiteboarding‚Äù module in this course.
- Think out loud! This is the most important thing you can do. Even if you‚Äôre way off-base with your answer, if your thought process makes sense and is easy to follow then you will leave a positive impression in your interviewer‚Äôs mind.
- Take notes on any feedback and constructive criticism. Remember, you‚Äôre both trying to help each other improve.
