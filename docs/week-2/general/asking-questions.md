# Asking Questions

There is usually a moment in any interview process where you get to ask questions of your interviewer. Sometimes candidates are tempted to say, "no, I'm good," but that's a mistake.

This is an opportunity to demonstrate that you care about your future at the company and about your potential future co-workers. It's also a chance for you to really learn if the role is a good fit for you.

Remember, it's a two-way interview. You're checking them as out as much as they're checking you out! ðŸ˜Ž

There's obviously a balance to things like this - you don't want to make your interviewer feel bombarded with questions. It should be a natural conversation where you ask one clear question, give them space to think and respond, and then really listen to their response.

Select 1-5 questions you like from the reference below (there are over 50 to choose from!) and be ready to ask questions when you're given the opportunity.
