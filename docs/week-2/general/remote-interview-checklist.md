# Remote Interview Checklist

The world is a-changin', y'all. These days, companies that used to fly you out for in-person interview events are running the whole operation online through tools like Zoom.

Some companies are going back to requiring everyone to work in an office, some are going with a hybrid model where employees are expected to visit the office a few times a week, but many notable companies have gone fully remote with no plans to return to the office anytime soon.

Whether or not you've worked remotely or had a remote interview before, it's important you know what you need to be successful in this type of online setting.

We've got you covered. Here's a checklist you can use for every remote interview to make sure you're good to go.

## Remote Interview Checklist

- [ ] Get a stable internet connection
- [ ] Test your webcam
- [ ] Use headphones
- [ ] Test your microphone
- [ ] Find a quiet, well-lit area
- [ ] Breathe and stay positive

### Get a stable internet connection

Nothing is more frustrating than losing time and getting all flustered in your interview because you've got a laggy or unstable internet connection.

Even if you have to relocate somewhere for the interview time, set yourself up to succeed by not worrying about your internet dropping out on you in a really critical time.

### Test your webcam

A big percentage of human communication is non-verbal. It's expected that you'll be on camera for remote interviews. You can use a built-in laptop camera or an external webcam plugged into your computer.

Practice being on camera because doing it for the first time during an interview is needlessly nerve-wracking.

### Use headphones

Headphones will minimize external noise for you and your interviewer. You can also better control how well you can hear them, which makes answering challenging questions way easier. Plus, headphones usually help you avoid feedback issues.

### Test your microphone

You're an engineer, so you're definitely smart enough to get your mic settings dialed in.

You don't want to blow your interviewer's head off with an overly-loud mic input level. Oh, and you also don't want to make your interviewer strain to hear you either. Test this out during Speak\_ to find the right levels so it goes smoothly in your interviews.

### Find a quiet, well-lit area

Go somewhere you won't get interrupted and can stay focused.

Try to get enough light in front of you so that your face is visible and not in silhouette (that's just creepy). Face the window when bright light is coming in. Turn on all the lights in your room. If you wanna get super fancy, get one of those ring lights all the Instagram influencers use. üíÅüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Breathe and stay positive

Breathing helps calm your nerves and focus.

It brings you into the moment, which is great because thinking of the past (_I should've prepared more_) or the future (_what if I don't get this job?_) can sometimes be stressful.

If you can remain optimistic and positive before and during your interview, you'll be able to better manage any bumps in the road, and your interviewer will appreciate that, too.
