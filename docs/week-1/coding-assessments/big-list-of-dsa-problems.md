# Big List of DS&A Problems

Welcome to the Big List of DS&A Problems. This curated list of data structure & algorithm challenges is designed to help you study for online technical assessments in a structured way. (You can also pull from this list for the pair sessions.)

The key to success? Practice, practice, practice!

## About the List

We’ve curated Leetcode problems based on key topics so you don’t have to hunt for them. Each topic has a “top challenge”, which is a commonly seen problem on technical assessments, and then “additional challenges”.

If you find the top challenge tricky and need additional practice, work through the additional coding challenges for that topic. Many of the problems use the same strategies with slight variations, so look for patterns!

Treat this list like a buffet. You do not need to be able to solve every problem on this list in order to pass the upcoming technical assessment. It’s just a guide, meant to be used as an overview of the types of questions that you might run into. Cool? Cool.

Here are some study tips to help you get the most out of algorithm practice:

- Set a timer (we recommend 30 minutes per problem).
- Practice in the same room where you would take a real assessment.
- If you struggle with a challenge, look up (aka google) a solution to see how it was answered. Then, try that problem again the next day.

## Big List of DS&A Questions

The questions below will help you prepare for online assessments. We recommend attempting to solve the **Top Challenge** and then looking up a solution walkthrough on YouTube.

Even if you're able to get the test cases passing, looking up a solution will help you see other ways to approach the problem.
