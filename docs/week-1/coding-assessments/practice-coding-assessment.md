# Cohort challenge: Practice coding assessment

Let's get some practice taking a coding assessment.

The following assessment is 2 questions and has a 90-minute time limit.

It's just practice! We want you to get the experience of using an assessment tool like Coderbyte because assessments are often the first step in a company's hiring process. Knowing what to expect can make the whole thing a lot less scary!

Click on the following link to open the assessment in Coderbyte.

## Important Notes

1. Use the same email address that you used for this course.
2. Use only 1 programming language for the entire assessment. Do not change languages between challenges. (Doing so will confuse your interviewers and look like you're googling for answers and using whatever language you happen to find. 😵)
3. Once you hit "Begin assessment", a timer starts and can't be restarted, so don't bother opening it to see the problems and then try to come back once you've googled the answers. 😝
4. Don't log in as some other fake account to see the problems to cheat. Assessment platforms track your IP address and things like that, and if you get caught cheating in a real assessment, you'll get immediately rejected. It ain't worth it.

## Tips

- Again, copying and pasting will trigger cheating detection within assessment software like Coderbyte or HackerRank. Re-type your code in to avoid this flag.
- This is a practice assessment. If you take it and don't pass, that has nothing to do with any employer assessments. The only way you can really fail is to not take this assessment. 🙂
