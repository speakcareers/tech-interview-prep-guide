# Coding Interviews

Technically, not all tech interviews are technical. But the coding interview definitely is. üòù

## What is a coding interview?

In the coding interview, you‚Äôre usually matched up with a member of the team that you‚Äôd be working with if you got hired and tasked with a realistic challenge, which might mean whiteboarding or live coding. (More about these types of interviews in other modules.)

Sometimes a coding interview is just another Leetcode question -- but this time with the watchful eyes of a potential team member. If that's the case, remember to use [REACTO](/docs/week-1/coding-assessments/dsa-tips.md) to really shine.

The challenges that you‚Äôre given will usually not require more than 30-45 minutes to complete, and you‚Äôll work through them in real-time under the guidance of your interviewer. They‚Äôll watch as you work, ask clarifying questions, and nudge you in the right direction if you get off track.

There are a few things the interviewer is looking for.

### Does your reality match your resume?

We hear a lot from employers that it‚Äôs a big red flag if they start digging into experience listed on a candidate‚Äôs resume and it turns out things weren‚Äôt represented honestly.

We also hear that anything on your resume is fair game for questions during the coding interview, and your interviewer will know how to code and be able to tell if you understand these topics.

Be honest and be willing to show off what you do know and admit when you don‚Äôt know something. Nobody knows everything!

### How well can you code?

In addition to being able to complete the task, the interviewer might be paying attention to your code formatting, how often you use comments, your naming conventions, and more. Before you go into the interview, you should do a bit of research into the company‚Äôs best practices and see if they have a public style guide that you can follow.

### How well can you communicate?

Coding in a coding interview is less about the code itself and more about your thought process, attitude, ability to solve problems, and receptiveness to input from others. Be a great communicator by clearly explaining what you‚Äôre doing, why you‚Äôre doing it, and what you expect the result to be.

Stay positive and take any hints the interviewer gives you along the way.

### How well can you work with others?

The person interviewing you might become your day-to-day teammate. Be receptive to their input and keep in mind that they‚Äôre trying to help. If you‚Äôre resistant to hints and interrupt them when they‚Äôre speaking, you‚Äôll leave a negative impression. Follow their guidance, use their suggestions, and work with them to solve the challenge.
