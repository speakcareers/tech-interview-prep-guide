# Cohort challenge: Pair programming

Pair programming is an important interview skill.

## How to find a partner

The easiest way to find a partner is to head to the Speak\_ discord server.

There is a channel called “#pair-up-here” where people are _always_ looking for people to pair program with. To find a partner, here’s what we recommend:

Head over to the “#pair-up-here” discord channel and look for a partner.

First, check to see if someone else is already looking for a partner. Connect with them!

If everyone else in the channel has already paired up, make a new post asking for a partner. Be sure to include your time zone and/or programming language if that's important to you.

Once you've found a partner, just follow the format below.

## Format (1 hour)

1. Pick a LeetCode challenge from the [Data Structures & Algorithms](https://learn.speak.careers/courses/dsa) course to work through
2. Pick someone to drive and someone to navigate
3. Set a timer for 30 minutes. Then switch roles.

## How to submit this assignment

After you've paired up and done a programming session, fill out this form.
