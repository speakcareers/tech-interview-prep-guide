# Challenge: Set your intentions

## What is an intention?

An intention is a **commitment to yourself** to follow through on something.

Typically, an intention follows the format:

:::note template

"During the next week, I will partake in at least [MINUTES] of [ACTIVITY] on [DAY] at [TIME OF DAY] at/in [PLACE]."

:::

Here‚Äôs a good example:

:::note example

‚ÄúOver the next month, I will do at least 60 minutes of Leetcode practice every Tuesday and Thursday at 7pm in my office.‚Äù

:::

## Why should you set one?

The simple step of writing down when, where, and how you plan on reaching your goal can have a powerful effect. Doing so makes it much more likely that you follow through on your plans.

Science-backed data shows that an [implementation intention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention) (like the one above) can result in a higher probability of successful goal attainment. It makes sense - getting specific and visualizing an outcome makes it more likely to come true. üîÆ

And there's a bunch of science that supports this.
