# Welcome to Week 1

Huge props for committing to preparing for your future tech interviews. That dedication is going to pay off. 🙌🏽

To kick off Week 1, we'll talk about the power of intention setting, then dive into topics including resumes, coding assessments, recruiter screening calls, and coding interviews

If you're in a cohort, stay tuned to the cohort channel in Discord and the weekly workshops to get a recommended timeline for staying on track with this material.

If you're following this guide on your own, we recommend dedicating about an hour a day to reading the material and practice. Feel free to [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/wjnAEVjbCu) for some community support.

Ready to go? Ok, let's roll! 🏎️
