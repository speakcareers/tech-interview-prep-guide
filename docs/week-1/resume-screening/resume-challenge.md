## Speak\_ Resume FAQs

<details>
  <summary>
  <strong>Question:</strong> I already have a great resume, do I need to use the Speak_ Resume Template?
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes.</p>
    <p>

  <strong>Question:</strong> When I use this template, my resume becomes 2 pages long. I’ve heard that it’s better to have a 1-page resume. What should I do?
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> It’s okay to have a 2-page resume as long as the content supports the length!</p>
    <p>You should not eliminate important content from your resume simply to keep it to 1-page.</p>
    <p>If you keep it to 1-page, great. But 2 page resumes are a-okay, too. And in many cases they’re necessary to show off all of the incredible skills that you have.</p>

  <summary>
  <strong>Question:</strong> I don’t have any previous work as a software engineer. Does that mean I should leave the Experience section blank?
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> You should include professional work experience, especially if you are making a career transition. But you should not include completely irrelevant work like barista, cashier, retail salesperson, or server.</p>
    <p>If you worked in an office and did most of your work on a computer, then you should include that work — even if it isn’t software engineering.</p>
    <p>If you worked at a fast food restaurant to pay your rent while you went to college, you should not include that.</p>

  <summary>
  <strong>Question:</strong> Can I remove the Education, Experience, Projects, or Awards & Certifications sections?
  </summary>
  <div>
    <div>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. If you do not have anything to include in a section then you may remove it. However, every section that you remove decreases the strength of your resume.</p>
    <p>Instead of removing a section, we recommend working hard to fill in the holes on your resume.</p>
    <p>For example, if you don’t have projects, then spending time working on 2 high-quality projects would be an excellent use of your time.</p>
