# Resume tips

:::tip GOAL

At the end of this module, you will have an awesome resume. Weâ€™ll use it to try and refer you to roles at our partner companies and youâ€™ll also be able to use it on your own to apply for jobs outside of Speak\_.

:::

## What is the Speak\_ resume?

Weâ€™ve worked with recruiters at our partner companies to come up with the ideal resume.

It gets straight to the point, but still gives you a chance to show off your strengths. Itâ€™s also well-designed, so it looks good and gives off a strong first impression.

To make this resume template, we talked to hiring managers to find out exactly what theyâ€™re looking for. Then, we trimmed away the excess _resume bloat_ and fine-tuned everything.

The result? A streamlined, concise, powerful resume. Customized for you.

The catch? Thereâ€™s nowhere to hide. ðŸ‘€

As you fill out this resume, you may notice that you have some weak areas. Thatâ€™s okay! The rest of this course will help address those weaknesses.

By the end of the cohort, you will feel confident that your resume is as strong as possible. Plus, youâ€™ll have a roadmap to fill in or bolster any weak areas.

## Simplify, simplify

A great resume answers the questions:

1. Who are you?
2. What skills do you have?
3. Is your experience level a match for the role?
4. What was your precise contribution to the things listed on your resume?

The Speak\_ resume template makes it easy to answer these questions. But even more importantly, it makes it easy for recruiters and hiring managers to find what theyâ€™re looking for.

We do this by using a simplified template that highlights the important things.

## Write good resume bullet points

Each Experience and Project that you list on your resume can have up to 4 supporting bullet points. It is a really good idea to make use of all 4 bullet points, but each point needs to be powerful.

**In your Projects section you should make your bullet points as robust as possible.**

- Remove nondescriptive bullet points and instead write longer sentences about what the app does, what technologies you utilized, and your specific contributions.
- Remember, you're showing off your programming skills to any tech recruiter that happens to see your resume. So make each bullet point a little bit technical.
- Each bullet point should be about something you did and not just a general description of what the project is. Tech recruiters and hiring managers want to know what your contributions were.

### Bad bullet point examples

- Managed project design.
- Built a text-based cryptocurrency exchange.
- Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js hosted on Heroku and Netlify.

### Good bullet point examples

- Used Next Image to preprocess and optimize images which resulted in 30% faster load times and a responsive user experience.
- Wrote Bash, PowerShell, and Python scripts to automate the deployment of
  software profiles on a network of 150 computers.
- Incorporated Machine Learning AI using Python and NEAT that supports infinite difficulty levels and can be implemented on any 2D track.

:::tip Here's a good framework to help you write better bullet points:

- [Action word] [technology] [skill/task] [result/impact]

## Formatting matters

When it comes to resumes, you know what tech recruiters love to see? Clarity. Skim-ability.

Seriously. Boring is good here.
