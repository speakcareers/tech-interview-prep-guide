# Cohort challenge: Get resume feedback

Before you submit your resume, get some feedback from your peers by posting a draft of it to the Google Spreadsheet below. Hereâ€™s how:

:::danger Wait!

If you are uncomfortable sharing personal details like email with the cohort, just remove them before posting your resume draft to the spreadsheet. **But make sure to add them back in before submitting your resume!**

:::

1. Make a copy of theÂ [Speak\_ resume template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13hNno_vTl6j5gbgqGKta9eXLpR4GFZyG/copy).
2. Follow the formatting in the Speak\_ Resume template exactly and update it with your information.
3. Click the share button on the top right of the Google doc and set it so that General Access is set toÂ *Anyone with the link*Â and Role isÂ *Commenter.*

4. Copy the link and share it onÂ [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T--4qAQwWEMZqcG4RjTaJwpOw9UNfa0YvkM62v9A_Hc/edit?usp=sharing).
5. Review 3 other resumes and put your name in the "Reviewed By" column on the spreadsheet. Leave constructive feedback based on the [Speak\_ Resume Rubric](/docs/week-1/resume-screening/speak-resume-assignment#speak_-resume-rubric) listed above. You can also say nice things if their resume already looks great!

**Things to comment on:**

- If the formatting doesnâ€™t match the template.
- If any of the bullet points could be rewritten to be more effective.
- Any typos or grammar mistakes that you notice.
- Suggestions on how to improve the Summary.
- Ways to make previous work experiences more compelling.
- Any links that are not correctly embedded. (email, LinkedIn, Github, Portfolio, Project Repos)
