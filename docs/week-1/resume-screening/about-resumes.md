# Why resumes are important

Pretty much all employers have a hiring process that works to quickly assess anywhere from dozens to tens of thousands of candidates before choosing to spend more time considering them as potential employees. That's why the resume became a thing.

Resumes are a short document that concisely list your experience, credentials, and individuality. Love it or hate it, a resume screening is almost always the very first step in the hiring process. That means to even get an interview, you're going to need your resume to pass that pesky screening phase. ðŸ˜–

This group of modules will cover resume tips and give you a super specific format to use to ensure your resume is easily scanned by recruiters and hiring managers.

:::note Cover letters

We don't get into cover letters in this guide. Ask 2 recruiters what they think of cover letters and you'll get 2 different opinions. ðŸ˜‚

Some recruiters don't look at them at all, some of them value the personalization and care the candidate put into them.

We recommend you don't spend a lot of time messing with cover letters. But if you make them, be sure they're customized for the specific company you're applying to and emphasize why you want that specific job and why you're the right person for it.
