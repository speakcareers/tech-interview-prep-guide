# Resume rubric

On the lesson called `Challenge: Update your resume` in this module, we'll share the Speak\_ resume template with you so that you can complete it and submit it.

For Speak\_ to attempt to match you with partner companies, you must follow the rubric. If your resume doesnâ€™t check all of the boxes below then we cannot accept it.

:::danger important! Do not change the formatting.

**If you change the formatting then your resume will be automatically rejected.**

We cannot share your resume with our partner companies if you don't follow the rules listed below. Formatting is important.

Do not change:
- Fonts
- Colors
- Margins
- Line spacing
- Section titles
- Text alignment

You can always make another version to share outside of Speak\_. ðŸ˜‰
