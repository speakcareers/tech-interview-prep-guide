# Resume rubric

On the next page, called `Challenge: Update your resume`, we'll share the Speak\_ resume template with you so that you can complete it and submit it.

For Speak\_ to attempt to match you with partner companies, you must follow the rubric. If your resume doesn’t check all of the boxes below then we cannot accept it.

:::danger important! Do not change the Speak\_ Resume Formatting.

**If you change the formatting then your resume will be automatically rejected.**

Do not change:
