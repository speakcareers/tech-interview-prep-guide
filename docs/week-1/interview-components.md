# Interview Components

Tech companies (especially FAANG/MANGA - or whatever the new acronym is for all the top tech giants) have a multi-step interview process that covers a broad range of skills. 🧑🏾‍💻

Depending on the type of role that you're applying for, you'll have to:

- Prove that you know how to code
- Show that you know about the company and its values
- Demonstrate that you have the *right stuff*™️ to excel at the job

**Here are some of the things you might run into during your interviews.**

1. Resume screening
2. Coding assessments
3. Screening calls
4. Pair programming
5. Whiteboarding
6. Behavioral quizzes
7. Take-home projects
8. Presentations
9. Technical interviews

It can feel like a lot, right? But fear not - you're in the right place. Speak\_ will teach you how to crush every step of the interview process so you can go into your interviews feeling prepared, confident, and ready to land that job.

The lessons in this course are all designed to prepare you for the components above. Each one is important, so let's get started! 🏃🏼‍♂️
