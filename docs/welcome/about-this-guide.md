This page will give you an overview of what to expect and how to get the most out of this experience.

## Why you need this guide

Despite being in high demand, many entry-level software engineers struggle to find their first job.

In fact, the typical software engineering job search can last months. Many entry-level software engineers waste time applying for hundreds (or even thousands) of jobs that they aren‚Äôt qualified for. Or worse, that they wouldn‚Äôt even take if offered the role!

The reason many programmers struggle with the job search is that they focus on the wrong things.

- Nitpicking over fonts and colors
- Applying to thousands of jobs without a clear strategy
- Building a ton of shallow projects based on YouTube tutorials
- Aimless networking that comes across as spammy and insincere

If this sounds like you, don‚Äôt despair. You're not alone.

But there‚Äôs a better way!

In this guide, we‚Äôll help you spend time doing the right things with the goal of getting hired fast.

Over the next two weeks, we‚Äôre going to help you streamline your job search.

### You will...

2. Begin to build an effective developer portfolio
3. Learn powerful frameworks for both hard and soft skills
4. Make a bulletproof study schedule with built-in accountability
5. Grow your professional network with genuine connections
6. Practice real interview skills with real people

You‚Äôll be on your way to an amazing dream job if you take action and follow through on all the strategies outlined here. üöÄ

## A few quick notes

### What this guide is‚Ä¶

- **It is open source.** Come back often to see updates, new strategies, and improved workflows. And if you have suggestions on how we can improve the guide, please contribute by clicking "Edit this page" at the bottom of each post!
- **It is a step-by-step guide,** so go through it in order. Each module that you complete will get you one step closer to landing your dream job.
- **It is actionable.** In each module, you will learn a key concept and how to apply it. We‚Äôll show you what you need to do, but it‚Äôs up to you to follow through.
- **It is an evergreen resource.** The job landscape is constantly shifting, but the strategies outlined here will _always_ help you. You‚Äôll be learning and applying a holistic job search strategy created specifically for software engineers.
- **It is a cohort-based guide.** The magic of cohort-based experiences is _the community._ Make sure that you join the Speak\_ Discord. The discord will have live communication, important announcements, bonus resources, and so much more. **[Join here.](https://discord.gg/wjnAEVjbCu)**

### What this guide is not‚Ä¶

- **It is not a listicle.** (You know, ‚Äú10 things every engineer must do‚Ä¶‚Äù) Tactics can only get you so far, so we‚Äôd rather help you build a solid job-searching foundation.
- **It is not ‚Äúset it and forget it.‚Äù** This guide will take work, but the lessons here outline a complete strategy to successfully search for jobs. Follow through on everything and continue to use what you learned even after you finish.
- **It is not a coding bootcamp.** Unfortunately, we don't have the time to teach you the fundamentals of programming. This guide is designed for people who know how to code. We'll help you sharpen your skills and get ready for interviews, but we won't cover technical topics in-depth.

## How to use this guide

This is a cohort-based experience. That means there are other software engineers going through this exact process _right now._ Team up with others and be active in the community in order to get the most out of this opportunity.
