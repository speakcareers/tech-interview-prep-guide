# About Speak_

## Social hiring

Speak\_ is a new tech startup that's reinventing the hiring experience for Gen Z. Employers use our platform to give value to their candidates, whether or not they get an offer. ‚ú®

Through community, content, and events, we deliver a social candidate experience that helps each individual prepare for their interviews, grow their network, and sharpen their skills.

## Our mission

We've also grown a diverse community of software engineers to help connect underrepresented talent to the job opportunities they deserve. We offer 100% free resources - including this guide and its cohort-based course - to help prepare candidates for the interview process at top tech companies that value diversity.

The job search process can be lonely and stressful, but it doesn't have to be.

What if you could practice with peers and get the exact help you need to perform well in tech interviews? What if it were a collaborative experience with personalized support?

That's the world Speak\_ is creating! üåà

We believe there's not a lack of information online, but it can be hard to know what's important and to learn and improve on your own. Curated, social experiences are the best way to prepare you to ace the interview and thrive in your first or next role.
