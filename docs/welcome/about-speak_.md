# About Speak\_

Speak\_ exists to connect underrepresented talent to the job opportunities they deserve.

Through content, community, and events, we give software engineers access to networks and knowledge. We offer 100% free resources, including cohort-based courses, to help prepare candidates for the interview process at top tech companies that value diversity.

The job search process can be lonely and stressful, but it doesn't have to be.

What if you could practice with peers and get the exact help you need to perform well in tech interviews? What if it were a collaborative experience with personalized support? What if you actually got value from interviews, whether you get an offer or not?

That's the world Speak\_ is creating!

We believe there's not a lack of information online, but it can be hard to know what's important and to learn and improve on your own. Our courses are designed to be a social, curated experience to prepare you to ace the interview and thrive in your first or next role.
