# How to contribute

This guide is completely free and open source. That means _you_ have the power to suggest changes to make it better for the whole community! ðŸŒž

To suggest changes, just click the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of any page. That will open up the source code on Github. You can edit the page right there on Github.

You can also clone the [whole repository](https://github.com/speakcareers/tip), make changes locally, and then submit a pull request on Github. Please only create pull requests on the `main` branch (the `prod` branch is locked and reserved for the production version of this site).

The Speak\_ team will review all edits and pull requests and merge in appropriate updates.
