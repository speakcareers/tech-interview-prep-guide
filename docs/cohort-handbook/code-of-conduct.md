# Code of conduct

By participating in the Speak\_ community - including messaging on Discord, attending events, taking courses, and contributing code to this guide - you agree to our code of conduct. ðŸ«¡

We expect full cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.

_Be excellent to each other, show empathy, and help make this a safe space to grow._

## Pretty much this

Speak\_ is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, experience, or religion (or lack thereof).

We do not tolerate harassment of Speak\_ participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate, including anything communicated on Discord, calls, events, social media, or any other outlets.

Speak\_ participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the Speak\_ team.

## More specifically

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of programming or other content, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Speak\_ team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the Speak\_ team immediately by direct messaging Team Speak\_ on discord or by emailing learn@speak.careers.

Thank you for respecting this code of conduct and making the Speak\_ community a special and safe place for everyone who wants to participate.
