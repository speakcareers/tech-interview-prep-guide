## Get the most out of this experience

Past participants say the Speak\_ Tech Interview Prep cohort is intense! There‚Äôs a lot to cover in a short amount of time, but going through all of the material and applying what you learn is guaranteed to make you look (and feel!) more hirable.

The cohort is structured to last 2 weeks, but the materials here will be available to you even after the cohort ends. Our recommendation is to focus on the community while the cohort is active.

### During the cohort

- **Be active in the community.** Participate in the live events, connect with your peers, ask lots of questions, and follow along with the recommended schedule.
- **Do lots of pair programming.** Learning how to speak aloud while coding is an important skill for software engineers in the job search. Pair programming is the best way to practice.
- **Do lots of mock interviews.** Interviews can be scary, but they don‚Äôt need to be. Practice answering common behavioral interview questions and get feedback to improve your answers. Do this enough and you'll go into interviews feeling confident and well-prepared.
- **Take lots of practice assessments.** We‚Äôll provide some practice assessments, but we‚Äôll also teach you how to make your own. Love 'em or hate 'em, online assessments are the #1 way companies screen potential software engineers as the first step in their hiring process. Get really good at algorithms to give yourself a huge advantage.

### After the cohort ends

- **Refine and improve.** During the cohort, you‚Äôll learn a bunch of ways to spice up your resume, your portfolio, your project READMEs, and more. Revisit the checklist below often to make sure that you‚Äôre keeping everything updated and optimized.
- **Stay focused.** There will always feel like a million things to do, but most of them aren‚Äôt going to help you land your next role. Stick to the strategy outlined in the guide and don‚Äôt get sidetracked thinking that you have to learn a new language, master a new tool, or build a new Twitter clone in order to get hired.
- **Put in the work.** Until you land your first job (hopefully soon!) you should treat the job search as a priority. This includes studying, practicing, and coding. But it also includes doing outreach, making connections, and applying for jobs. We‚Äôll give you an example schedule to ensure you‚Äôre spending enough time on everything, but it‚Äôs up to you to stay consistent and keep working toward your goals.

## Job search checklist

At the end of this guide, it‚Äôs our hope that you have everything you need to land your dream job. Here's a handy checklist you can use to make sure you're getting all the value out of this experience.

We recommend writing this checklist down and putting it somewhere where you'll see it every day. As you go through the materials, check each of these items off as you complete them. üí™üèø

- [ ] I have a strong resume
- [ ] I have an effective developer portfolio

**Ongoing**
