# After the cohort

Congrats! 🎉 You've made it through an _intense_ 2 weeks and learned a whole bunch of secrets about how to stand out during job interviews.

We hope you’ve gotten a lot of value out of participating in the cohort and working with your peers in the community. It was a fast-paced couple of weeks and you should be proud of the work you did to improve your chances at landing a great new job.

## What happens now?!

Now that you've joined the Speak\_ talent base, Whenever you're eligible for a role at one of our partner companies, we'll share your resume with them for review. It's then up to them who to invite to their company-specific community, followed by an interview.

We're adding new partner companies every month, and we’ll continue to try and match you with job opportunities. You’ll get automatically invited if you’re eligible, so no need to reapply or go through another cohort.

Otherwise, you're all set and we genuinely hope you learned a lot about the technical interview process and feel much more confident heading into your interviews. Your dream job is just around the corner! 💰
