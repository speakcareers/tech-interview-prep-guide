# FAQ

These are some frequently asked questions about the Speak\_ cohort.

### How do I enroll in a Speak\_ cohort?

You can [apply anytime](https://airtable.com/shrk5CgnTodb43nuj) to be considered for upcoming Tech Interview Prep cohorts.

All employer-specific interview guides are invite-only.

### Who can join the Tech Interview Prep cohort?

Anyone who is ready to accept a full-time or internship job offer is welcome to join the Speak\_ Tech Interview Prep cohort. Just [apply](https://airtable.com/shrk5CgnTodb43nuj) and youâ€™ll be invited to the next cohort.

### How can I get invited to an employer guide?

Candidates who participate in the Tech Interview Prep cohort, complete a Speak\_ resume (a specifically-formatted resume we share with our employer partners), and take a practice coding assessment will be added to our talent base.

Once youâ€™re in our talent base, weâ€™ll try to match you with job opportunities available now and in the future. Weâ€™ll email you to see if youâ€™re interested, and if the employer wants to get to know you further then youâ€™ll be invited to join a specific employer guide to prepare for their exact interview process.

Thereâ€™s no timeline for this because the job market changes quickly. Employers one day need a specific role filled and the next day itâ€™s been filled. Even criteria for one role can change based on a hiring managerâ€™s request or some other factor within a company.

We add new partners every month, so we continue to try to find opportunities for you even after youâ€™ve completed a guide.

We canâ€™t guarantee youâ€™ll be invited to an employer guide. We wish we could guarantee jobs, but thatâ€™s not something anyone anywhere has figured out yet. ðŸ˜…

### If I submit an application on the Speak\_ website, am I applying for a job at Speak\_?

No. Submitting an application means youâ€™re applying to join our talent base for the possibility of getting matched with one of our partner companies and, optionally, getting invited to upcoming cohorts.

### How long are the cohorts?

The Speak\_ Tech Interview Prep cohort is 2 weeks long. Youâ€™ll need to put more or less hours depending on your level of proficiency.

Employer-specific cohorts map onto the exact interview process for each employer. They might be 1 week long or over a month.

### How often do your cohorts happen?

We run 2 Tech Interview Prep cohorts a month. The first cohort of the month starts on the first Wednesday of the month.

Employer-specific cohorts are rolling based on when candidates are invited to join.

### What is the format for the training?

Speak\_ cohorts consist of:

- Cohort workshops
- Multiple pair sessions with peers
- Access to guides including hard & soft skill sharpening content
- Access to private discord chat channels
- Support from engineers recently hired
- Support from the Speak\_ team

### What programming languages/technologies are taught in guides?

Itâ€™s important for you to know that Speak\_ does not teach you how to code. Weâ€™re not a bootcamp. We provide training that helps you sharpen your existing skills and prepare for tech interviews.

You can participate in the Tech Interview Prep cohort using any programming language of your choice.

Some employer guides will help you warm up your proficiency with technologies like API frameworks, Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Jest, Express.js, Android Studio...itâ€™s based completely on the employer and role youâ€™re interviewing for. Whatever is needed in the interview, we want to make sure youâ€™re prepared.

### Is the Tech Interview Prep cohort specific to certain jobs?

This guide covers pretty much any tech interview. But, we specialize in helping candidates prepare for interviews for these roles:

- Full Stack Engineering
- Backend Engineering
- Frontend Engineering
- QA/SDET Engineering
- DevOps Engineering

### What is the time commitment for candidates?

Tech Interview Prep cohort participants should expect to dedicate at least 6 hours per week to a guide.

For employer cohorts, we recommend a minimum of 4 hours per week, but the more you put into the experience, the more youâ€™ll get from it!

### How much does Speak\_ cost?

Nothing! Everything we offer is completely free for candidates. No strings attached. The only thing we ask of you is to actively participate in our community and help others grow and learn. ðŸ–¤

### Do I have to sign a contract or ISA (income sharing agreement) to enroll?

Nope! No contracts - just your commitment to engaging in the guide and giving it your all from start to interview!

### Can Speak\_ help me find an internship to satisfy graduation requirements?

While we do plan to add more, weâ€™re just getting started with adding internship opportunities, so itâ€™s best that you look to Speak\_ only to help you prepare for your internship tech interviews and not to find new internship roles.

### I donâ€™t have a Computer Science or related degree. Can I still apply?

Absolutely, yes! We often have access to job opportunities with our partner companies that do not require a specific degree.

### Can people outside the United States join a Speak\_ guide?

Yep! All are welcome. Our partner companies have roles open for candidates in countries outside the US. Those opportunities change monthly.

Please note that our live cohort events happen at 5pm PT / 8pm ET, which might be inconvenient for people in certain time zones. All events are recorded so that cohort participants who couldnâ€™t attend can still get access to all the content.

### Will I get hired if I complete an employer cohort?

That would be so cool, but, no. Thereâ€™s no guarantee youâ€™ll get an offer. But you will be more prepared for your interviews, and therefore more likely to get hired.

We guarantee that youâ€™ll be seen and reviewed by any companies we refer you to. Beyond that, itâ€™s up to you and your potential employer. ðŸ”®

### Who are your employer partners?

They vary every month. We've worked (and continue to work) with companies like Roblox, Amazon, Robinhood, GoDaddy, Socotra, Bonusly, Gainwell, Remitly, Optera, and more.

### Can I participate in multiple Tech Interview Prep cohorts?

Not at this time. We have hundreds of candidates participating each month, and we don't have the resources to provide a high-quality experience indefinitely to each candidate.

Also, weâ€™ve found that it's not serving anyone well for you to repeat a skill-sharpening program if what you really need is to go learn skills. That might mean joining a bootcamp or studying up on the skills where you need to improve.

Participants retain access to all guides and can recreate their own cohort-like experience by pairing up with others in the community at any time. We'll keep adding features to facilitate your ongoing support post-program.

Candidates who let us know they canâ€™t continue in a cohort they are enrolled in can defer to a future cohort. Let us know before your cohort ends!

### How does Speak\_ make money? Is it a non-profit?

While we do have a big social impact mission (to eliminate underrepresentation within tech), Speak\_ is a for-profit company. We get paid by employers for connecting them with awesome candidates. Itâ€™s a win-win-win, right?!

### Can I refer people to join Speak\_?

Heck yes! Send them to [speak.careers](http://speak.careers) to apply. ðŸ˜Ž
