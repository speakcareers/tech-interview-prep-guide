# Welcome to the cohort!

:::info

The "Cohort handbook" guide module is for candidates actively participating in a Speak\_ Tech Interview Prep cohort.

Haven't joined a cohort? [Learn more.](/docs/welcome/about-cohorts) Or you can jump ahead to [Week 1](/docs/week-1/welcome).

### Introduction

Woohoo! Weâ€™re so glad youâ€™re here. ðŸŽ‰

This module in the guide will serve as your cohort handbook. It covers steps you'll need to take before you start the cohort, what to expect, what resources are available to you, and frequently asked questions.

There are 3 places for you to pay attention to during the cohort.

1. This guide.
2. The private cohort channel in the Speak\_ Discord. (See the [next lesson](/docs/cohort-handbook/before-you-begin) for details.)
3. Pinned messages inside the cohort channel.

If you have questions, ask them in the cohort channel and your Program Director will be there to support you.

### A new you

The Speak\_ Tech Interview Prep cohort-based course is designed to be an intensive and transformative experience. In just 2 weeks, youâ€™ll get prepared for technical interviews, learning everything you need to perform your best.

You might be already working a job, caring for your family, or finishing school, so we know your time is valuable. Regardless of your situation, you can use this opportunity to sharpen your skills and improve your chances of getting an offer. Youâ€™ll get out of it what you put in into it.

Our community is inclusive and supportive. You can be yourself here, and you can be vulnerable because weâ€™re all working toward the same goal - trying to be our best selves.

Speak\_ is not the company youâ€™ll be applying for, so you can let your guard down and not worry about being something youâ€™re not. We hope you can be exactly who you are, where you are, and letâ€™s lift each other up because thereâ€™s a perfect role out there for each of us.
